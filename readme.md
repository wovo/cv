Amersfoort

I run a webshop for microcontroller chips and related products. My customers range from entry-level hobbyists to small-scale professionals, the occasional a large company or a school. Most customers are in the Netherlands and Flanders, but a fair number is spread all over the world. I sell components, kits (both from kit suppliers and of my own design), ready-built circuits, and software. I buy from suppliers in the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, USA, India, and China.

As time permits I…

MPTE is a visual simulator of the ERA robot arm, the space station on which the robot is used, and the environment of the space station (sun, moon, earth, stars). MPTE is used for mission preparation and for cosmonaut training.

I created automated test procedures for a number of simulation models developed at LNR. The procedures test both the functionality and the test path coverage (using Tcat-Path). I also rewrote and corrected the model code and wrote (or rewrote) the detailed designs.

SmartNet is a communication system designed for military purposes. Its original intended use was as a voice and data communication system in military vehicles (tanks), either stand-alone or in groups (headquarters). An important civil customer is the NS (Dutch railways) where it is used to carry video, voice and data over the existing glass fiber infrastructure.

I contributed to the system design of SmartNet, especially the interface definitions, the testability, the transport of…

The European Robotic Arm (ERA) is a robot arm for the Russian section of the international space station ISS. As the prime contractor Fokker Space is responsible for the system design, the project management and the integration and testing of the total system.

I worked mainly on the central computer of the arm and on the datacommunication within the arm. Critical aspects were the performance of the processor and the reliability of the (Ada) compiler. Contacts with the subcontractors…

DM90 is a real-time data-communication and data-acquisition product, sold mainly to for industrial process control (AKZO, DSM, ALDEL). A DM90 is a real-time DEC VAX with software developed by ICT that handles the communication with various industrial control systems (Honeywell, TDC, Siemens, AEG, SattControl). A DM90 gathers and stores real-time data and presents this data in a uniform way to a VAX-VMS system.

I worked as (E-Pascal, C, Fortran) programmer, designer, trainer and as team…

The hospitals laboratory performs analysis on blood samples. The analysis requests are provided by the hospitals mainframe. The majority of the analysis are performed on automated analysis machines.

I designed, implemented (TurboPascal) and introduced a network of PCs. One PC gets the requests from the mainframe, and feeds the authorized result back. The other PCs are each coupled to one or more analysis machines and receive the analysis results via RS-232 interfaces. These PCs are also…
