## Profile

I am a software professional with a passion for electronics.
I often work on the boundary between hardware and software. 
I have a solid background in my field of work, 
(the technical application of software), 
and adequate knowledge of neighboring domains 
(mathematics, electronics, physics, chemistry, biology). 

I am quick to learn the essences of new subjects. 
I have worked in industrial, space and military domains in various roles 
where electronics, reliability, resource constraints, real-time aspects, 
and data-communication were important factors.

I started my career as programmer with the hiring company ICT Automatisering, 
for which I worked internally and externally at various projects. 
I became a 'problem solver' for technically challenging problems that 
involved both software, and other technical domains. 
For me 'solving' means identifying and (as far as possible) 
quantifying the consequences of the available alternatives, 
so a well-founded decision can be made. 
Often the non-software aspects (hardware, costs, risks, schedule impact,
politics, company culture) are what makes a problem really interesting (and challenging).

In 2001 I started as an independent, with a webshop and hiring myself out as a freelancer. 
The shop expanded, and the freelancing was replaced by fixed-price contract work,
and a small assignment as lecturer. 
My main activities were with Microchip PIC, and ARM/Cortex micro-controllers. 
I sell these chips (and related components), design products with them, and teach their use.

From 2010 onwards the webshop declined, and I focused more on lecturing.
As a lecturer, I pass my knowledge and experience on to new generations
of embedded software engineers.
I combine different work formats:
written material, lectures (life and recorded), 
interactive work sessions,
home assignments, individual and group projects.
Most of all, I activate the students own motivation by
providing individual challenges.

I am a firm proponent of using C++ for small embedded (micro-controller) systems.
I have held talks at various C++ conferences on this subject,
and I participate in SG14, the GameDev & low latency ISO C++ working group.

I work at the section Technical Informatics (Computer Science) 
of the HBO-ICT institute, where
I am overall responsible for the 1.5 years of TI curriculum.
I coach and guide colleagues, create course material, 
give lectures, and guide and supervise students.

I initiated and manage the lab, which is the place where lecturers, 
freshmen and senior students meet, discuss, and work on projects.
I also initiated the visiting of local meetings (the Dutch C++ group)
and international conferences (code::drive, FOSDEM, EmBo++).
This started with a small group of senior TI students, and was gradually
expanded to interested students of all years and other sections of the institute.

My specialization is programming small embedded (micro-controllers) systems in C++.

I also did some freelance jobs that are mentioned below, 
contract embedded software development, and due-diligence code base audits.

MPTE is a visual simulator of the ERA robot arm, 
the space station on which the robot is used, 
and the environment of the space station (sun, moon, earth, stars). 
MPTE is used for mission preparation and for cosmonaut training.
<BR /><BR />

I created automated test procedures for a number of simulation models developed at LNR. 
The procedures test both the functionality and the test path coverage (using Tcat-Path). 
I also rewrote and corrected the model code and wrote (or rewrote) the detailed designs.

SmartNet is a communication system designed for military purposes. 
Its original intended use was as a voice and data communication system 
in military vehicles (tanks), either stand-alone or in groups (headquarters). 
An important civil customer is the NS (Dutch railways) where it is used to carry video, 
voice and data over the existing glass fiber infrastructure.
<BR /><BR />

I contributed to the system design of SmartNet, 
especially the interface definitions, the testability, 
the transport of synchronous data and the scalability. 
I created a tool that can be used to assess the feasibility 
of a SmartNet configuration.

of the international space station ISS. 
As the prime contractor Fokker Space is responsible for the system design, 
the project management and the integration and testing of the total system.
<BR /><BR />

I worked mainly on the central computer of the arm 
and on the datacommunication within the arm. 
Critical aspects were the performance of the processor 
and the reliability of the (Ada) compiler. 
Contacts with the subcontractors (SAAB, DASA, CRI/Matra, Tecnospazio, Alsys/Aonix) 
were an important part of my work. 
I also worked on the automated testing facility for 
the engineering model of the central computer.

The hospitals laboratory performs analysis on blood samples. 
The analysis requests are provided by the hospitals mainframe. 
The majority of the analysis are performed on automated analysis machines.
<BR /><BR />
I designed, implemented (TurboPascal) and introduced a network of PCs. 
One PC gets the requests from the mainframe, and feeds the authorized result back. 
The other PCs are each coupled to one or more analysis machines 
and receive the analysis results via RS-232 interfaces. 
These PCs are also used to select the analysis that are 
to be performed and to authorize the results.
